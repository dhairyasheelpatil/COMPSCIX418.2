# Session Three

In this session you will learn more about the structural design pattern category

## Design Exercise
Design an account management system for users to sign up and log in
    * Account CRUD: create, read, update and delete account
    * Sign in and Log in: this step creates a user session after logging 
    * Forget password: user should be able to restore account information in case user forgets password
    * Analytics: how many users the system has, how many log ins and sign ups
    

## Refactoring Exercise
We have a DB table holding on to users information, for example home address. We need to perform analytics operations on the data we collected from different users.

Look at the DTO.java class, discuss what needs to be improved and why?
